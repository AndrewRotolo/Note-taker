# Note-taker

## Description

An application that lets you take and save a set of notes to be referenced whenever the user likes.

## Usage

Simply navigate to the application at [not online yet. see "Known Issues" for more info] or run the server.js file in node.js and then navigate to http://localhost:3001. The rest is fairly self-explanatory

## Known Issues

This application is not yet complete. Please be aware of the following issues

-Note deletion has not been implemented. As a workaround, you can delete notes manually in the ./db/db.json file

-New notes require a server restart before they will properly render in the application.

-Notes do not currently have a unique internal ID and instead use a placeholder.

-Due to technical issues on the developer's side, the application is not yet deployed to an active domain. For now, the user must manually run the server locally (port 3001)
